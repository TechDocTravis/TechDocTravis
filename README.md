- 👋 Hi, I’m @TechDocTravis
- 👀 I’m interested in automating basically anything that you can stick an ESP32 on with some velcro and reverse engineering expensive equipment and devices that should be repairable
-    but are not due to the companies thinking that will get more sales(ps- it doesn't help them).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ESP32 program development in arduino kind of on accident but it's my new favorite thing. It started when I had a repair come into my shop for a hot tub pump
-    circutboard that had one capacitor that had puked it's guts out and died. Fixed that issue. Board had power on the correct rails, but it didn't turn on. Owner bought a new remote
-    thinking sure that'll do the trick. Well it didn't . Researching the unit I then saw the LC12s wireless UART device attached to the pump half of this unit. Went down the rabbit-
-    hole of reading about wireless uart devices, esp32s, TTL, Arduino IDE, AT commands, how to count with a base16 numerical system, SPI, Serial to TTL converters, Bus Pirate's ,
-    how to use a logic analyzer to tell what language a device is speaking, or at least use an oscilloscope to try :( And well I'm a little tired but I'm still alive..
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tearing down all the walls around any device that should be repairable like the LC12s units on the intex pure spa wireless hot tub pump system.
